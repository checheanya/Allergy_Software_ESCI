## UML diagrams

Here you can find class and use cases diagrams as well as activity and sequence diagrams for each use case. The names of the fies represent the codes of use cases according to the SRS file. All diagrams are presented in two formats: picture itself in the *png* format as well as code that generated it. <br>
For most of them we used [plantuml tool](https://plantuml.com/sequence-diagram).
